Hi! I am Abhinav, a programmer and tech enthusiast. Programming is my passion and a driving force to improve myself. I have set up this blog using Jekyll and Bootstrap and I must say, I prefer this system over Wordpress. 

The first advantage of this system is automatic backup. Well, not exactly automatic but more like you make a post on your pc and then upload it to the site. So a copy of the site is always present on your computer. 

The second advantage: NO FREAKING DATABASES BS. It's static. I love it.

So here I am with my MacBook trying to think what my second post would be. May be I'll write a tutorial on how to setup your own static website over at GitHub with the help of Jekyll and Bootstrap. 

Oh yeah one more thing. Stay tuned for various tutorials on topics like Raspberry Pi HTPC, C# WinForms is BS (WPF FTW) and lots of Java/Python stuff. 

Signing off.
