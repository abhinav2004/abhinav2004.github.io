<h2>Namaskar!</h2>
My name is Abhinav Hardikar. I am a developer and I develop stuff. :)

<h2>Profession</h2>
I currently work as a Junior Software Engineer for a German MNC, 
working mainly in .Net technlogies and also web technologies like Typescript, ASPNET,
AngularJS and ocasssionaly Java, Python, Scala and JSP. I also know how to make RESTful web services using ASPNET 4/5, JSP/Tomcat and Node.js.

<h2>Interests</h2>
I used to call myself an avid cyclist and I did cycle a lot, but ever since I got a job, I have not been able to cycle to my heart's content. 
So I am an ex-avid cyclist. I also like electronics. I have a Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc and I do experiment with them. I might even upload some 
tutorials over here.
