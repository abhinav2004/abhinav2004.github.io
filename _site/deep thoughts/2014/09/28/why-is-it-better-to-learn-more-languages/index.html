<p>I have worked in Java for about 7 years and doing the same thing over and over does make the experience boring; a change in interest was inevitable. I have tried multiple programming languages like C, C++, Scala, Python and Ruby but I couldn't find a single language with a philosophy of "Compile once, run everywhere", and now even java does not follow that any more. We'll discuss about this in a later rant.</p>

<p>I am so used to this philosphy of programming. But generally, a person does not get what he wants; most of the times. This is one of those cases. You have to work with what you have.</p>

<p>Having little experience with the so called "IT Industry", I can say one thing. You will never - or rather most of the times - get to work with the language you like. The company where I am working as an intern uses C# and the .NET framework. C# is one of the better programming languages and is quite like java; but .NET framework is terrible. I hate their APIs and documentations. More over, the company has forced us to use only WinForms making the .NET experience even worse. And I am a Java programmer. :(</p>

<p>But, can I do anything about this issue? As programmers, we need to ask this question to ourselves. Once we commit to a company and their choice of language, it is difficult to persuade them to use any other language. And that's pretty obvious. So we are left with two choices.</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a job which uses the language you like.</li>
<li>Learn more languages and get used to them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Option 1 sounds quite easy doesn't it. But doesn't that reduce your options while searching for a job. Say for example you know only Go Language. How many companies are there which want Go programmers. It just makes your life difficult.</p>

<p>As long as you don't want a difficult life, the only option left is to learn more languages. But there are so many languages! How many should one learn you might ask. I have only one answer to that. It totally depends on your capacity. Try to learn as many you can. Learning doesn't hurt but does take time. But you know; you will realise, while learning these languages, that your learning speed is increasing exponentially. That's because most of the language structures (not syntaxes) are very similar. Once you know that common stuff, learning other languages becomes easy.</p>

<p>Learning more languages increases your field of view and opportunities to get a good job.</p>

<p>There you go. That's the answer to why is it better to learn more languages. Hope you enjoyed it and stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Signing off.</p>
